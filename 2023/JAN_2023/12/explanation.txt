# 12_Jan_2023  Minimize the Sum
# TC: O(NlogN)[avg]; SC: O(N)

How to Approach: 

Nothing special today for this question,just use a single for loop to track over the index of the array.
And, then use python bisect module to have insort the array with inserting the sum element at proper position.
Finally return the minSum.

How to Approach: 

TC: O(N); SC: O(1)

Here we have to find the sum of values of data of all child nodes to replace the original node data.
You can easily replace by calculating the leftNode sum and rightNode sum.
But me want to try somewhat different,just using postOrder traversal.Iterate towards left storing the data temp single length array.
And,when the traversal switches to postOrder one,passed temp to [0] to drain out the previous sum.
Finally update root.data equals total leftSum+rightSum-root.data
